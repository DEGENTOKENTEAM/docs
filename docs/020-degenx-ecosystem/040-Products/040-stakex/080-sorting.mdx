# STAKEX - Sorting

The Sorting is giving you control and overview of your NFTs. Hypothetically there will be many stakes that you create. Either by staking or by re-staking. <br /><br /><img src={require('/img/stakex/sorting/1.png').default} style={{maxWidth: 400}} />

In order to not lose track of things, you can sort the NFTs based on several conditions.

- **Most recent stake:** The list shows you the youngest stake you’ve created on the top of the list, and the oldest ones at the bottom.
- **Oldest stake:** The list shows you the oldest stake you’ve created on the top of the list, and the youngest and most recent ones at the bottom.
- **Burned stakes first:** This shows you the burned stakes on top of the list, since these stakes can be the best rewarded ones.
- **Most stakes:** This shows you the biggest stakes on top of the list.
- **Next unlocked stake:** This option will sort the stakes that are ready to withdraw on the top of the list.
