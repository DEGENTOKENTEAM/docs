# STAKEX

## Introduction

**STAKEX** is an [audited staking protocol](https://github.com/solidproof/projects/blob/d1a57884ece9a092cb3a2a8c219a3bd77a5493a6/DGNX/SmartContract_Audit_Solidproof_StakeX_from_DEGENX.pdf) providing a new staking methodology, powered by the DEGENX Ecosystem. It's a deployable protocol for projects based on EVM networks like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Base, Arbitrum, Avalanche, and more.
<!-- 
STAKEX is gearing up to transform into DEGENX's premier staking platform, a move that promises to redefine the way holders of DGNX tokens can benefit. By choosing to stake your DGNX tokens on STAKEX, you're not just holding them; you're putting them to work. This action entitles you to a share of the profits generated from DEGENX's suite of revenue-producing products. Although the inner workings of the protocol remain under wraps for now, the anticipation builds around what will be an unparalleled experience in the DeFi ecosystem. -->

### Core Features

- **Multiple Staking Pools:** Offers various staking pools, each with its own stake lock period.  
- **Custom Shared Rewards:** Pools can have one or more custom shared rewards.
- **Multiple Reward and Payout Tokens:** Supports diverse reward tokens and multiple payout tokens using on-chain oracles.
- **UniswapV2 LP Conform Swaps:** Supports liquidity provider token swaps.
- **GMX Market Support:** Available on Avalanche and Arbitrum networks.
- **Infinite Staking Pool Option:** An option that burns the staking token for lifetime rewards.
- **Reward Injection:** Rewards can be injected by anyone or restricted to specific smart contracts and external owned accounts.  

### Management and Customization

- **Management UI:** A user interface for managing the protocol
- **Post-Deployment Extensions:**
  - **Reward Assets:** Add new rewards after deployment.
  - **Target Assets:** Add new payout tokens post-deployment.
  - **NFT Composition:** Add and update your NFT composition assigned to a specific staking pool.
- **Custom Fees:** Implement custom fees for various protocol actions, including staking, unstaking, and restaking.
- **Block- and Time-Based Activation:** Activate the staking protocol based on specific blocks or time periods for pre-event benefits.

### NFT Integration

- **NFT Representation:** Stakes in pools are represented as NFTs, which can be traded and transferred. Unique NFTs for Staking Pools: Create customized NFTs for each defined staking pool. Composable NFTs:
- **SVG Composition Tool:** Design unique NFTs using four types of SVG elements (`<rect>`, `<text>`, `<image>`, and `<path>`).
- **Protocol Metrics as SVG Elements:** Metrics are provided as `<text>` elements.
- **OpenSea Metadata Standard:** Compatible with OpenSea's metadata standards for NFTs.

### Practical Applications

- **Revenue Generation:** If your ecosystem lacks revenue generation, gamify the staking process by adding individual fees for stake, unstake, and restake actions.
- **Pre-Event Activation:** Use block- and time-based activation to enhance holder benefits from protocol fees before special events.
- **Custom NFTs for Engagement:** Design and assign customized NFTs to staking pools to increase user engagement and provide a unique staking experience.

For newcomers to the crypto scene, here's a breakdown of what this all means:

- **Staking:** This refers to the process of locking up a certain amount of your cryptocurrency tokens (e.g. DGNX tokens) in a smart contract to support the operation of a blockchain network. In return for your contribution, you earn rewards, often in the form of additional tokens.

- **DGNX Tokens:** These are the native tokens of the DEGENX platform. Holding these tokens not only signifies your stake in the ecosystem but also enables you to participate in staking and earn rewards.

- **Revenue-Generating Products:** DEGENX operates various products or services that generate income. This could include anything from transaction fees on a decentralised exchange, yields from lending protocols, or profits from other DeFi products. -->

STAKEX sets the stage for token holders to be part of a pioneering technology within the DeFi sector. STAKEX is not just about staking tokens; it's about being part of a cutting-edge financial revolution that offers a fresh and profitable experience for its participants.
