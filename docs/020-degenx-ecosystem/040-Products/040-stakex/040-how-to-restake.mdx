# STAKEX - How to Restake

The restaking process is nearly the same as the staking process, except you don&apos;t need to enter an amount of staking tokens. If the protocol has been configured with more than one reward token, it’ll buy staking tokens from the market and restakes it in the protocol, creating a new NFT with the desired parameter you chose while restaking. 

These are the steps:  

1. Look up for the NFT you want to restake the rewards from

2. If you have rewards available for re-staking, you can look for the desired NFT in the list of your available NFTs. You can also use the Sorting, if you’re about to look for a specific staking pool.

3. You can press on (1) enabled Restake buttons. The NFTs that have no rewards available will have a (2) disabled Restake button and can't be pressed <br /><br /><img src={require('/img/stakex/how-to-restake/3.png').default} style={{maxWidth: 400}} />

4. Once you click on the Restake button, you will get prompted with a popup that shows you more information about the rewards that are gonna get restaked. <br /><br /><img src={require('/img/stakex/how-to-restake/4.png').default} style={{maxWidth: 400}} />

5. Since it's the same process as for staking, you need to choose a (1) Reward Multiplier & Duration option. <br /><br /><img src={require('/img/stakex/how-to-restake/5.png').default} style={{maxWidth: 400}} />

6. You will also have to confirm the action by checking the checkbox <br /><br /><img src={require('/img/stakex/how-to-restake/6.png').default} style={{maxWidth: 400}} />
