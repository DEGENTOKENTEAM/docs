# STAKEX - How to Re-Stake

The re-staking process is nearly the same as the staking process, except you don’t need to enter an amount of staking tokens. If the protocol has been configured with more than one reward token, it’ll buy staking tokens from the market and restakes it in the protocol, creating a new NFT with the desired parameter you chose while re-staking. 

These are the steps:  

1. Look up for the NFT you want to re-stake the rewards from

2. If you have rewards available for re-staking, you can look for the desired NFT in the list of your available NFTs. You can also use the Sorting, if you’re about to look for a specific staking pool.

3. You can press on (1) enabled Re-Stake buttons. The NFTs that have no rewards available will have a (2) disabled Re-Stake button and can't be pressed <br /><br /><img src={require('/img/stakex/how-to-restake/3.png').default} style={{maxWidth: 400}} />

4. Once you click on the Re-Stake button, you will get prompted with a popup that shows you more information about the rewards that are gonna get re-staked. <br /><br /><img src={require('/img/stakex/how-to-restake/4.png').default} style={{maxWidth: 400}} />

5. Since it's the same process as for staking, you need to choose a (1) Reward Multiplier & Duration option. <br /><br /><img src={require('/img/stakex/how-to-restake/5.png').default} style={{maxWidth: 400}} />

6. You will also have to confirm the action by checking the checkbox <br /><br /><img src={require('/img/stakex/how-to-restake/6.png').default} style={{maxWidth: 400}} />

7. In the box (1) you will see the amount of staking token that will be re-staked and the (2) Est. Unlock Date. <br /><br /><img src={require('/img/stakex/how-to-restake/7.png').default} style={{maxWidth: 400}} />

10. Once you have confirmed the action in your wallet and the transaction ran through, you will receive a success message. You can finish the process now by pressing the Close button. <br /><br /><img src={require('/img/stakex/how-to-restake/10.png').default} style={{maxWidth: 400}} />
