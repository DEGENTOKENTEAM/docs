# STAKEX - Introduction

There are 2 ways for you to claim your rewards. You can either (1) Claim the rewards for a specific NFT, or you can (2) Claim All Rewards.

You will see your (1) Unclaimed Rewards in the top box. This is the aggregated amount of rewards you’re able to claim. You are also able to see how many tokens (2) you have staked in total. If the protocol has a stable token configured, you will automatically see the (3) amount of rewards in this token. You can change this in the (4) settings.

You can change the “View Token” setting to any token that is configured in the protocol. 

The above mentioned setting is also available for the token that you want to claim your rewards in. You will see this in the claiming process.

## How to claim rewards from a single NFT

1. Look up for the NFT you want to claim the rewards from. <br /><br /><img src={require('/img/stakex/how-to-claim-rewards/single/1.png').default} style={{maxWidth: 400}} />

2. If you have rewards available for claiming, you can look for the desired NFT in the list of your available NFTs. You can also use the (1) Sorting, if you’re about to look for a specific staking pool.<br /><br /><img src={require('/img/stakex/how-to-claim-rewards/single/2.png').default} style={{maxWidth: 400}} />

3. You can only click on (1) enabled Claim Rewards buttons. The NFTs that have no rewards available will have a (2) disabled Claim Rewards button. <br /><br /><img src={require('/img/stakex/how-to-claim-rewards/single/3.png').default} style={{maxWidth: 400}} />

4. Once you click on the Claim Rewards button, you will get prompted with a popup that shows you more information about the rewards. 

5. If the protocol has configured multiple payout tokens, you can choose one of the available (1) Payout Token. In the (2) box you will see the (3) reward amount in the selected payout token. The (4) approximate reward amount is a more realistic amount of rewards, because it includes the fees that are being charged by the market makers. <br /><br /><img src={require('/img/stakex/how-to-claim-rewards/single/5.png').default} style={{maxWidth: 400}} />

6. Once you press the Claim Rewards button, you will get prompted with a popup. This popup instructs you to check your wallet for further actions. <br /><br /><img src={require('/img/stakex/how-to-claim-rewards/single/6.png').default} style={{maxWidth: 400}} />

8. Once you have confirmed the action in your wallet, you will receive a success message. After pressing the Close button, the claiming process is completed. <br /><br /><img src={require('/img/stakex/how-to-claim-rewards/single/7.png').default} style={{maxWidth: 400}} /> <br /><img src={require('/img/stakex/how-to-claim-rewards/single/8.png').default} style={{maxWidth: 400}} />


## How to claim all rewards

1. Above the list of NFTs, you will see a Claim All Rewards button which you can press, to proceed with the claiming process. <br /><br /><img src={require('/img/stakex/how-to-claim-rewards/all/1.png').default} style={{maxWidth: 400}} />

2. The Claim All popup is getting prompted and contains information about all NFTs that have rewards and that you are going to claim right now. You can now proceed with the same steps as the Claim (single NFT) process, starting with step 5. <br /><br /><img src={require('/img/stakex/how-to-claim-rewards/all/2.png').default} style={{maxWidth: 400}} />
