# STAKEX - How To Withdraw?

The withdrawal process is similar to the claiming process, except that you’ll get paid out your staking tokens in the same step, and the NFT will get burned. You can only withdraw tokens if the lock period has passed and the staking tokens weren’t burned in the beginning. 

These are the steps to take to withdraw your staking tokens:
1. Look up for the NFT you want to withdraw. Use the sorting “Next unlocked stake” to find the most recent NFTs that are able to withdraw. <br /><br /><img src={require('/img/stakex/how-to-withdraw/1.png').default} style={{maxWidth: 400}} />

2. You can only click on (1) enabled Withdraw buttons. The NFTs that have a burned stake or a lock period that has not passed yet, will have a (2) disabled Withdraw button. <br /><br /><img src={require('/img/stakex/how-to-withdraw/2.png').default} style={{maxWidth: 400}} />

3. Once you click on the Withdraw button, you will get prompted with a popup that shows you information about the rewards you're about to claim in the withdrawal process. <br /><br /><img src={require('/img/stakex/how-to-withdraw/3.png').default} style={{maxWidth: 400}} />

4. If the protocol has configured multiple payout tokens, you can choose one of the available (1) Payout Token. In the (2) box you will see the (3) reward amount in the selected payout token. The (4) approximate reward amount is a more realistic amount of rewards, because it includes the fees that are being charged by the market makers. <br /><br /><img src={require('/img/stakex/how-to-withdraw/4.png').default} style={{maxWidth: 400}} />

5. Once you press the Withdraw & Claim button, you will get prompted with a popup. This popup instructs you to check your wallet for further actions. <br /><br /><img src={require('/img/stakex/how-to-withdraw/5.png').default} style={{maxWidth: 400}} />

6. Once you have confirmed the action in your wallet, you will receive a success message. After pressing the Close button, the withdrawal process is completed. <br /><br /><img src={require('/img/stakex/how-to-withdraw/6.png').default} style={{maxWidth: 400}} />
