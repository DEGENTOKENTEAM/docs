# STAKEX - General Information

In the box of the General Information tile, you will see some overall statistics of the staking protocol. (1) Locked TOKEN is the aggregated number of staking tokens that are locked in the protocol right now. If the protocol has a stable token (such as USDC, USDT, or DAI) configured, you will also get information about the (2) Locked TOKEN in $ of the locked staking token. You can interpret this value as the total value locked (TVL) of the protocol.  
  
With (3) % of Locked TOKEN you can see the percentage compared to the total supply that has been staked in the protocol. The (4) Total Stakes names the amount of NFTs that have been generated and are not burned. So you'll have the exact amount of active stakes. You also receive the information about the (5) Total Stakes Burned. This is the overall number of NFTs that have burned stakes. 

The (6) Total TOKEN Burned shows you the amount of staking tokens that have been burned through this protocol. Last but not least, you also see the (7) Average Lock Period of the protocol. It is getting shown in days. You can see, if the protocol is (8) offline. This means, the protocol is disabled and inactive for stakers to use. <br /><br /><img src={require('/img/stakex/general-information/offline.png').default} style={{maxWidth: 400}} />
