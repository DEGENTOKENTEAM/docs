# DGNX - Staking

## About

Our staking offers DGNX holders a unique opportunity to participate in the income streams generated by our ecosystem. The revenue generated will primarily be used to maintain and develop the ecosystem. After covering these costs, we will provide a consistent or increasing Annual Percentage Rate (APR).

## Revenue Distribution

The revenue will be distributed across four staking pools, each with a different lock-up period:  

| Lock Period | Reward Share | APR |
| ----------- | -----------: | --- |
| 1 month     | 5%           | tbd |
| 6 months    | 15%          | tbd |
| 12 months   | 25%          | tbd |
| Forever     | 55%          | tbd |

## How To Stake

If you're new to our Ecosystem and want to contribute via staking, you can look up the [How to Buy DGNX](/docs/020-degenx-ecosystem/030-Dgnx Token/020-buy-dgnx.md) section.

If you already have DGNX tokens, you can visit our [staking section in the DEGENX dApp](https://dgnx.finance/dapp/staking) and look up [How To Stake](/docs/020-degenx-ecosystem/040-Products/040-stakex/030-how-to-stake.mdx) in order you need more information about how you can stake your DGNX.

## Audits 

Our goal is to make our protocols as secure as possible. We therefore subject our protocols to a variety of smart contract security audits.
