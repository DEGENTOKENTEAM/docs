# Governance & DAO

At the core of our organization lies a robust DAO governed by proposals. These proposals play a pivotal role in determining the future trajectory of our organization. To actively engage in the decision-making process, you have the power to vote by delegating your voting power either to yourself or a trusted address. Your voting power is directly tied to the amount of DGNX tokens you hold, reflecting your influence within the community. Once you have successfully delegated your voting power, you gain the ability to actively participate in voting and make your voice heard.

:::caution
You need to delegate your voting power BEFORE a proposal is being active. If you delegate it after a proposal being activated, you will not be able to participate in voting.
